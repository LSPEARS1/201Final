                            <article>
                            
                                <p>I have a lot of vivid imagery associated with the American Dream. My younger years in California left me with a lot of miner-forty-niner imagery. As I finished growing up in Arkansas, I started to incorporate images of the old cowpoke, proud of the little he has. It has always meant pure grit, sheer will, and hope for a lucky break.</p>
                            
                                <p>It’s a struggle for me to communicate exactly what the American Dream means to me spiritually. At the time of writing this, I remember the Lord Jesus Christ saying “how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings” (Matt. 23:37). Christ certainly said this in a different context, but the warm imagery is still possible to conceptualize in relation to the American Dream. Just as physically, the dream is about striving to have more than you have now, with sincerity and grit, the American Dream spiritually, is about becoming selfless and holier. In many ways, it is living a Christian lifestyle so we can be those chicks gathered under Christ’s loving embrace. That’s quite a personal view and I reserve the right for development; however, it heavily influenced my research question for my largest undergraduate project I would complete at Brigham Young University.</p>
                            
                                <p>I used a priming experiment with 520 people for the basis of my research. A priming experiment is essentially a survey where there is a control group and a few other groups that are exposed to literature or asked to write about experiences they have had before taking the same exact survey as the control group. This lets the researcher see how the respondents answer when exposed to different thoughts or ideas.</p>
                            
                                <p>Overall, there were some pretty interesting results. Regardless of the group, a majority of respondents answered that they thought that the American Dream was about spiritual happiness and not material goods. Across all groups, 70% of respondents said that the American Dream was not about material goods and over 50% were sure it was spiritual happiness.</p>
                            
                                <p>That is profound! Is there something deeper than a nicer house or car that makes up the American Dream? When asked about it, many Americans tend to say yes.</p>
                            
                                <p>Perhaps my favorite result was that those that were primed with any religious thoughts, tended to believe they and others could achieve regardless of systemic barriers. This effect was magnified in the religious, Republicans, and especially in religious Republicans.</p>
                            
                                <p>There are so many reasons why this could be and certainly there are overlaps between these groups that are extremely difficult to hash out. Yet, I am enthused with the idea that religious people (especially if they are focusing on religious elements) tend to put more stock in overcoming boundaries with regards to accomplishing the American Dream. This could be because religious people frequently were more likely to choose spiritual happiness and this is more of a subjective thing to accomplish. However, I think a strong argument for trust in God, or faith, could be made.</p>
                            
                                <p>I will not lay that argument out here - instead, I would ask, does focusing on your faith help you believe that you can accomplish things with God’s help? Try it out, let me know!</p>
